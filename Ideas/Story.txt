        The mom is trying to pull the guards away from him yelling and screaming.
            You have internal thoughts like "Mom? Dad?"
        You yell at the guards to stop but they ignore you.
        They shoot the mom for trying to pull the guards off.
        You have on screen instructions to run over there. You are yelling "MOM!!"
            You try to run over but his friend/partner holds him back.
        You have the option to punch your friend to try to break free.
        Once you break free and knock him to the ground you turn around and try to run towards them but your partner grabs your leg and you fall too.
        You look up at the guards with your hand out. Your dad yells "You can kill me but you can't kill an idea!". You quietly say "dad.... mom...."
            The guards shoot his dad in the back of the head. Killing him. Main character has ultra feels.
