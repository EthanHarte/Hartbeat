Original idea for Alpha Game Jam. Now an ongoing project.  

**Original Concept by:** Ethan Harte, Alvin Vuong, Jeremy Rotman, Vipul Kashyap, and Julian Carney.  
**Contributors:** Jose Mayo (3D Artist)

*Today, we live in a world where our technology is becoming increasingly immersive. Our ambitions lie within a fully immersive* *VR game. So, we came up with the idea of creating game elements that bring the player closer to the virtual world that they are* *in.*  

*Our inspiration came from Gun Gale Online, a fictitious VRMMOFPS, where the player's heart rate is taken into account for the* *spread of their shots.*  

*Thus, we decided to implement a player's actual bodily reactions within the game world itself. Using an optical heart rate* *monitor wired up to an Arduino, we gathered heart rate information and, in-game, varied the spread radius accordingly. In the* *future, we also plan to use a force sensor with an elastic belt to detect breathing and implementing this in-game as well.*  

**Technologies Used:**
- UDK (professional 3D engine/toolset for game development: https://www.udk.com )
- Blender (open-source 3D animation suite: http://www.blender.org )
- Arduino (open-source physical computing platform: http://arduino.cc )
- Visual Studio Express (IDE used for our C++ DLL development: http://visualstudio.com )
- PulseSensor (Arduino heart rate monitor: http://pulsesensor.myshopify.com )
- Adobe Photoshop (raster graphics editor: http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop )
- Adobe Flash Professional (multimedia authoring program: http://www.adobe.com/products/flash )  

**Technologies Planned:**
- Breath monitor for breathing-related mechanics using a force sensor
- Emotiv EPOC for ??? (neuroheadset & SDK provided by Emotiv: http://emotiv.com/ )

**Texture Libraries:**
