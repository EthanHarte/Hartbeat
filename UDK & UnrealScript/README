***************************IMPORTANT*****************************

Place files in given path. Replace old versions.

To get default settings to work, delete the UDK built versions of 
those same files, then run the editor. The engine will generate 
new UDK files with those new settings.

Running the editor will also compile the scripts. Then when in 
the editor, under View -> World Properties, change game type
fields (there are two) to HBGame.  Now scripts should work.

Also when in the editor, make sure to open content browser and 
reload the flash .swf file and check packages. This will properly 
load the HUD.

In the Compile.bat and Compile2.bat files, it is possible to edit 
them to open up other maps as well.

Make sure that for DLL testing, you must compile the DLL and move 
it to the following path:
 = UDK/UDK-2014-05/Binaries/Win32/UserCode
Then use the Compile.bat file to compile the scripts and run the 
game.
